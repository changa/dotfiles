# Bunch of dotfiles (WIP)

There's nothing interesting here to see (yet)

## Usage

  * git clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/changa/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
  * boostrap: `cd ~/.dotfiles && make`
  * Profit!


## I have cold feet, can I have a glimpse of the result first?

Sure! Just do `HOME=/tmp/foo make` and everyting will be installed in /tmp/foo
instead of your actual home directory.
